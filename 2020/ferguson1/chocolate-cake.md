# Double-layered Chocolate Fudge Cake

## Last updated: Tue 19 Aug 2025 12:06:49 UTC

Here's a delicious double-layered chocolate fudge cake that is
something of my mum's speciality. It's complicated and I should warn that nobody
has seemed to get it down as well as she has but it's well worth the effort if
you love chocolate and have the time and patience.

My late stepmum who only liked white 'chocolate' loved this cake! The picture
below was taken for my birthday (14 February) in 2022 as it's the best one I
have:

There are two sets of ingredients and instructions; the cake and the icing. In
addition there are some **VERY IMPORTANT NOTES** to pay attention to; some will
be repeated because they're **VITALLY IMPORTANT** for the quality of the cake.
That cannot be overstated.

Below I have included the ingredients separately but I include them within the
instructions as well and in bold. Also in bold are some of the special notes.

Finally note that depending on where you are in the world this might not work in
the warmer months of the year and for the icing in particular.

Above all, **ENJOY**, and **I'D LOVE TO SEE PHOTOS AND HEAR WHAT YOU THINK** at
[@xexyl@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@xexyl). Questions also welcome
there of course. Please make sure to mention me so I get a push notification as
I don't check it very often. Thanks and again enjoy!


## Measurements

This was originally taken from an American magazine for women so the
measurements are in the US standards. There is a
[nice resource](http://www.onlineconversion.com/cooking.htm) that has much more than
just cooking). This will particularly matter for cups, teaspoons, tablespoons and ounces.


## Baker's chocolate

Baker's chocolate is a brand name and the product in question is unsweetened
chocolate bars used for baking. According to a [chocolates FAQ][] it might be
called different things:

> Bitter chocolate contains no sugar and is often called 'unsweetened' or
'baking' chocolate. In some countries it's called 100% cacao since it's composed
only of ground up cocoa beans, and nothing else.

The FAQ suggests that you might have to look for a baking supply shop but I
cannot offer any specific advice other than it's unsweetened chocolate bars for
baking. The FAQ talks about what looks like substitutes but I have no idea what
that would turn out as; I somehow suspect it wouldn't be good.

Either way **PLEASE STILL PAY ATTENTION TO ALL THE NOTES on the chocolate IN THE RECIPE and
RECIPE NOTES BECAUSE THEY'RE _EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!_**


## Special notes for the cake

**PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THESE:**

*   **USE _MARGARINE_! DO _NOT_ USE BUTTER!** Butter does not work well. If you
    think it will come out better by using butter you're very mistaken; it will
    come out badly! People have come back saying it didn't come out well and
    they are asked if they used butter or margarine. They had used butter
    because they 'know better' but they were very wrong and it is why the cake
    was ruined.

*   Over the years they changed the size of the unsweetened chocolate squares;
    they used to be one ounce each; now they are 1/4 ounce each square so be sure to
    remember that **THE AMOUNT IS BY OUNCE _NOT SQUARES_ AS LISTED**. See the
    measurements link if there's any doubt.

*   Pay careful attention to the **COOK FOR ONLY THE INDICATED TIME** part. Note
    that if your oven cooks a bit hotter you might have to adjust the timing a
    bit.  This is likely the case if the cake comes out a little bit dry.

*   **REMOVE THE CAKE FROM THE PANS _2 MINUTES AFTER REMOVING FROM OVEN_** and
    then allow to **FULLY COOL _ON RACKS!_** The important point is to **MAKE SURE
    THAT THEY _DON'T OVERCOOK_**.

*   **USE _WHOLE MILK!_** Don't try skim milk or whatever per cent of fat milk you
    have.

*   Use **ONLY _PURE_ VANILLA EXTRACT!** **DO _NOT USE IMITATION VANILLA!_** Not
    following this rule will lead to a worse outcome, including with the icing.


## Cake Ingredients

*   3 oz unsweetened (Baker's) chocolate
*   2 and 1/4 cups flour
*   2 tbsp baking soda
*   1/2 tsp salt
*   2 and 1/4 cups packed brown sugar
*   3 eggs
*   1 and 1/2 tsp **PURE VANILLA EXTRACT (_NOT IMITATION VANILLA!_)**
*   1/2 cup **MARGARINE (_NOT BUTTER!_)**
*   1 cup (boiling) water
*   1 cup sour cream


## Cake Preparation

0.  Lightly grease **TWO 9 x 1.5 INCH ROUND PANS** with shortening and then
lightly dust with flour. Even if you have a non-stick cake pan you should do
this! We have had it happen before (and I have seen it in other foods as well)
where the cake sticks to the pan. You do not want this to happen!

1. Preheat oven to **350 F / 176.67 C**.

2. Turn on the air conditioning if you need :-)


## Cake Directions

0.  Melt **3 OZ UNSWEETENED CHOCOLATE** in double boiler or small bowl over
    **hot (*BUT NOT BOILING*) water**; let cool whilst proceeding.

1.  Sift **2 and 1/4 CUPS FLOUR**, **2 TSP BAKING SODA**, and **1/2 TSP SALT**

2.  Beat **1 STICK MARGARINE (_NOT BUTTER!_)** in large bowl *until soft*. Again
    **MARGARINE, _NOT BUTTER!_**

3.  Add **2 and 1/4 CUPS PACKED BROWN SUGAR** and **3 EGGS**. Beat until light and
    fluffy.

4.  Beat in **1 1/2 TSP _PURE_ VANILLA EXTRACT (_NOT IMITATION VANILLA!_)** and
    **_COOLED_ MELTED CHOCOLATE**.

5.  Stir in dry ingredients alternately with **1 CUP SOUR CREAM**; always beat
    until smooth.

6.  Stir in **1 CUP *BOILING* WATER**.

7.  Pour into prepared pans.

8.  Bake for **ONLY 35 MINUTES** (**NO LONGER!**) at **350 F / 176.67 C**.

9. When you take the cake out put the cake pans on a cooling rack for **_ONLY
   TWO MINUTES AND THEN _IMMEDIATELY TURN CAKES OUT ON TO RACK_**. Let **COOL
   _COMPLETELY!_**

Assuming you use round cake pans, if everything is okay, it might look something
like this after pulling it out of the oven and putting it on cooling racks,
though these are very old cake pans and cooling racks:

### Cake tips

0.  It might be helpful if you have everything out before you start making the
    cake. It can also be helpful if you put things away after you use them.

1.  A double boiler does help but as long as it melts fine it should be okay.

2.  Keep in mind they no longer make things like they used to, and unfortunately
    some of the things are not made as good as they once were, so you'll have to
    make do with what you have available. We have VERY OLD brushes to grease
    pans and from what we have seen what they make now is harder to work with.
    But as long as you do grease it okay it should be fine. Again even if you
    have a non-stick pan do this!

3.  If you have a little batter left (but it should be very little) you might
    enjoy tasting it. On the other hand you should NOT taste the melted
    chocolate unless you like it bitter :-) (don't worry - it'll be the opposite
    of bitter in the cake). And yes at least one of us has tried this before,
    probably multiple times.

4.  You DO NOT HAVE to use round cake pans but they work nicely (and are great
    for double layer cakes).


## Icing Ingredients

*   4 oz unsweetened chocolate (Baker's chocolate)
*   1/2 cup **MARGARINE (_NOT BUTTER!_)**
*   4 cups powdered sugar
*   1/2 cup whole milk
*   2 tsp **_PURE_ VANILLA EXTRACT (_NOT IMITATION VANILLA!_)**

You will also need a bigger pan or bowl that can have ice water that the icing
bowl can sit in.

## Special notes for the icing

**PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THESE:**

*   **MAKE SURE** that the melted chocolate and **MARGARINE (_NOT BUTTER!_)**
    do not get solid.

*   For step #4 put **8 to 10 ICE CUBES** in a pan or big bowl (that's big
    enough that another bowl can fit in it). **ADD AN INCH OF WATER** and **SET
    THE BOWL WITH THE ICING IN THE PAN OR BOWL** of ice water. **DO NOT LET THE
    ICING GET WET!**

*   **DO NOT LET ICING GET TOO THICK.**

*   **USE _WHOLE MILK!_** Don't try skim milk or whatever per cent of fat milk you
    have.

*   Use **ONLY PURE VANILLA EXTRACT**! **DO NOT USE IMITATION VANILLA!** Not
    following this rule will lead to a worse outcome. As I recall the icing was
    quite a bit worse (but still chocolaty at least) the times we had imitation
    vanilla (simply because we couldn't get pure vanilla at the time we needed
    it). Just don't do it.

*   When the recipe was first written they sold powdered sugar in a box; now
    it's confectionery sugar in a bag. My mum experimented with the amount and
    found that 4 cups seems about right. This can be adjusted to your taste.

*   If you have leftover icing after icing the cake, for next time, it might be
    that you didn't put as much between the layers as we do. Of course you could
    put it elsewhere if you wish to.


## Icing Directions


0.  Combine **4 OZ UNSWEETENED CHOCOLATE** and **1/2 CUP *MARGARINE (NOT
    BUTTER!)*** in pan. Melt and remove from heat. **DO NOT LET IT GET SOLID!**

1.  Combine **4 CUPS POWDERED SUGAR**, **1/2 CUPS WHOLE MILK** and **2 TSP
    ***PURE* VANILLA EXTRACT (_NOT IMITATION VANILLA!_)** into a bowl. **STIR
    UNTIL SMOOTH**.

2.  Add chocolate mixture.

3.  Set bowl in pan/bowl of ice and water. Beat with spoon/mixer until it's
    thick BUT not too thick. **Make *SURE* ICING DOES *NOT* GET WET!** The idea is to
    **MAKE THE BOWL IT'S IN COLD *BUT TO NOT LET THE ICING GET WET!***

## Icing tips

0.  If the top layer starts to slide off, for instance because it's too hot where
    you are (this happens to us sometimes), you can get toothpicks and put them
    in the two layers so they stay together. We usually just keep them there and
    eat carefully but it might be possible to take them out - if you can remove
    them carefully.

1.  It is quite nice to have a thicker layer of icing between the two layers. If
    it's about the same as on the outside of the cake it's how we do it. If you
    have leftover icing when done it's very possibly because of this. However,
    you can adjust to your desire.

2.  A spatula is helpful when icing the cake. As there are a variety of types,
    shapes and sizes (often very different in type, shape and size, including
    flexibility) and as different people will find different kinds/shapes/sizes
    easier, you'll have to test it out for yourself. Using a knife probably is
    not a good idea even if it can work, if you have a spatula.

3.  Although it will depend on preference, I can say that a lot is put on even
    from the beginning. Just make sure you have enough for all parts. It might
    be helpful if you consider where you need the icing so you can gauge how
    much of the icing should be in each place. You'll want icing on top of the
    first layer (so between) and all round the cake as well. It is a thick layer
    in every place.  Remember that the icing is fudge!

4.  Don't put icing under the bottom layer of the cake! This might seem obvious
    but just in case.  When you slice the cake it should be on all sides, except
    that the top and bottom of the slice will be the cake itself (the icing will
    be between the two layers of course).

5.  You can and probably should adjust the icing to taste. It is something my mum
    does too - she will test taste the icing to be sure it's just right.

6.  Do make sure the icing is cool enough but if you follow the toothpick trick
    it should help if it is not quite enough.

7.  It is not an exact science. You might very well have to play with it a bit.
    With different spatulas and also less experience it might take a few tries
    to get it to where you want it. My mum has been doing this for at least five
    decades so she's had a lot of time to experiment with it! In other words
    don't worry about it too much.

8.  You do not have to make it pretty like the picture shows. Even if the final
    result doesn't look pretty it will not change the taste, supposedly :-) No,
    it really does not matter. You can try if you wish but if you're
    uncomfortable doing it or you don't know how that's perfectly fine.

9.  If you have a bit left over (though this should be very little) feel free to
    lick the spatula and bowl clean! :-)
