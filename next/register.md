# How to register for the IOCCC


<div id="step_a">
## Step A: Verify that the contest pending or open
</div>

The contest needs to be either [pending](../faq.html#pending) or [open](../faq.html#open)
in order to register for the IOCCC.

For details see the "[how the contest status impacts registration](#status_impact)" section below.


<div id="step_b">
## Step B: Enter your email address
</div>

- Visit the [IOCCC28 registration page](https://www.freelists.org/list/ioccc28-reg)
- Enter your email address
- Select ((Subscribe))
- Click the **((Next >>))** button

**NOTE**: For submissions with multiple authors, only one author needs to subscribe.

The first step of registering is to put in your email address in the field:
`Your Email Address`. Then select from the drop-down what you would like to do,
in this case you want to **Subscribe**.

After clicking **((Next >>))** and you will be notified that you will receive an
email. It will tell you that they have sent an email to verify your address.
Remember that if you don't receive it in a few minutes you should check your
**Spam** or **Junk** folders in case your email client or your ISP marks as
spam.

<div id="step_c">
## Step C: Open the Subscription consent email message
</div>

Look for an automated email message from the FreeLists List Manager (_ecartis@freelists.org_).

The email message will have the subject:

> Subscription consent for 'ioccc28-reg'

**NOTE**: be aware that some email services, applications and/or Internet
Service Providers (ISP) modify email subject lines.  For example, some string
might have been prepended or appended to the subject line.  Be aware of
this when you search for the "Subscription consent" email.

**NOTE**: The "Subscription consent" email is usually sent by the FreeLists
List Manager within a minute after clicking the **((Next >>))** button.
If you don't see the "Subscription consent" email, check your spam folder.

**NOTE**: If are having trouble receiving the "Subscription consent" email, and
you have tried a few times, [Contact the IOCCC](../contact.html) to ask the
[IOCCC judges](../judges.html) for assistance.

This email will contain a URL of the form:
`https://www.freelists.org/v/ioccc28-reg/SOME-RANDOM-STUFF`.

**NOTE**: If you prefer to **NOT** click links in email, simply copy that
URL from your "Subscription consent email" and paste it into your browser.

Note that the email should be from `FreeLists List Manager`.

<div id="step_d">
## Step D: Confirm your email click
</div>

In your browser, for the link referenced in [Step C](#step_c), click the
**((Next >>))** button. It is the page with the header text of `Verify your
email`.

<div id="step_e">
## Step E: Verify you have read the mailing list polices and that you consent to receiving emails
</div>

The FreeLists service requires that you verify that you:

- Have read, understand, and agree to their "_Terms of Service_"
- Have read, understand, and agree to their "_Privacy Policy_"
- Are the owner or authorized user of the email you registered

Once you have done this by clicking the 3 tick boxes (or if you prefer,
checkboxes), click the **((Next >>))** button.

After clicking **((Next >>))**, you will be notified that you will receive an
email. The website should say:

> All set! The last stage of the process has been started. You should receive a
verification email within a few minutes.


<div id="step_f">
## Step F: Read the Welcome email
</div>

You should receive an automated Welcome message from the FreeLists List Manager
(_ecartis@freelists.org_) with the subject:

```
    Welcome to 'ioccc28-reg'
```

Read the "Welcome" email.

**NOTE**: The "Welcome" email is usually sent by the FreeLists
List Manager within a minute after clicking the **((Next >>))** button.
If you don't see the "Welcome" email, check your spam folder.

**NOTE**: If are having trouble receiving the "Welcome" email, and you have
tried several times,
[Contact the IOCCC](../contact.html) to ask the [IOCCC judges](../judges.html)
for assistance.

<div id="step_i">
## Step I: Proceed with step 3
</div>

When the contest is [open](../faq.html#open), proceed with
[Step 3: Wait for your submit server username and initial password](../quick-start.html#step_3).

### When the IOCCC status is _closed_

While the contest is **[CLOSED](../faq.html#closed)**,
you **CANNOT REGISTER** as there is no contest for which you can register.

Watch the [IOCCC news](../news.html) and the [IOCCC Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ioccc)
for news about the next IOCCC as you may register when the contest is [pending](../faq.html#pending)
or [open](../faq.html#open).


### When the IOCCC status is _pending_

While the contest is **[PENDING](../faq.html#pending)**,
you may **register for contest**, however you will **NOT**
receive an email message containing your [IOCCC submit server](https://submit.ioccc.org)
*Username and Initial Password* **until the IOCCC is [open](../faq.html#open)**.


### When the IOCCC status is _open_

While the contest is **[OPEN](../faq.html#open)**,
you may **register for the contest**.  Once you are registered **AND**
the contest is [open](../faq.html#open), you will receive an email message containing your very own
**Username and Initial Password until the contest is [open](../faq.html#open)**.  You will need these
to be able to "**[upload your submissions](submit.html)**" to the
[IOCCC submit server](https://submit.ioccc.org).

See also the
FAQ on "[how to upload your submission](../faq.html#submit)"
for more information on the submission process when the IOCCC [reopens](../faq.html#open).


### When the IOCCC status is _judging_

While the contest is **[PENDING](../faq.html#pending)**,
you **CANNOT REGISTER** because the
[IOCCC judges](../judges.html) are in the process of judging the [submissions](../faq.html#how_many)
they received while the contest was [open](../faq.html#open).

Watch the [IOCCC news](../news.html) and the [IOCCC Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ioccc)
for news about the next IOCCC as you may register when the contest is [pending](../faq.html#pending)
or [open](../faq.html#open).
