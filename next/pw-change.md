# Change your submit server initial password

Using the **Username** and **Initial password** you receive via
email in [step 3](../quick-start.html#step_3), you need to login to the [IOCCC submit
server](https://submit.ioccc.org).

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: You must change your password within a fortnight (**14 days**)
from when one of the [IOCCC judges](../judges.html) sent that email.

**NOTE**: The [IOCCC submit server](https://submit.ioccc.org) will be ready
for submissions **ONLY WHEN THE CONTEST IS [open](../faq.html#open)**.  See
[current status of the IOCCC](../status.html) for details on the contest status.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: When the contest is [closed](../faq.html#closed), the
[IOCCC submit server](https://submit.ioccc.org)
may be offline and unreachable as a website.

To login and change your password, open [https://submit.ioccc.org](https://submit.ioccc.org)
in your browser. The important lines should say:

> **Status**: Not logged in.<br>
> **Username**: <em>Enter Username</em><br>
> **Password**: <em>Enter Password</em>

The username is the UUID you are provided when a judge replies to your request
to register for the IOCCC and the password is the initial password you are
given. Click "Login".

After you log in, if this is the first time you have logged in with this UUID,
you will be required to change your password. Assuming everything is fine, that
would look something like:

It will then tell you that you **MUST** change your password within a certain
time (that it will give you) and then tell you the following about the new
password:

> Please enter your current password, a new password, and then reenter the same
new password.<br>
> Your password MUST be:<br>
> - At least 15 characters long<br>
> - At most 40 characters long<br>
> - NOT contain nor be a sub-string of the current password<br>
> - NOT contain nor be a sub-string of your username<br>
> - New password must NOT have been [Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords)
>
> [Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords) passwords are passwords that have been previously exposed in some published data breach.

Again, if you do not change your password within fortnight (**14 days**)
your account will be closed and it'll say something line:

> **ERROR: Sorry (tm Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦) you cannot login at this time.**

If that happens, you will need to
[send email to the IOCCC judges](../contact.md#if-you-really-need-to-send-email-the-ioccc-judges)
to ask for your password to be reset.

Assuming you did login in time, you should put in your login (UUID username),
your old (initial) password and a new password and then click "Change Password".

**NOTE**: if you have put in your old password, you'll get the following error:

> **ERROR: Password not changed**<br>
> **ERROR: invalid old password**

Once you've changed your password successfully you will be able to log in again
with your UUID username and new password. When you have done this it will
report:

> â€¢ Password successfully changed.

When the contest is [open](../faq.html#open), proceed with
[Step 5: Obtain and compile the latest mkiocccentry toolkit](../quick-start.html#step_5).
