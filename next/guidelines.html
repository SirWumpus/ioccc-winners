(IOCCC)</a>.</p>
<p>These are <strong>NOT the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a></strong>, though it does contain comments
about them. The <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> should be viewed as
<strong>hints</strong> and <strong>suggestions</strong>. <strong>Submission that violate the
<a href="guidelines.html">guidelines</a> <em>but remain within the <a href="rules.html">rules</a></em></strong> <em>are
allowed</em>. Even so, you are safer if you remain within the <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC
guidelines</a>.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Of course if a guideline is talking about a rule and you break that guideline,
you stand a good chance of having your submission rejected for breaking the
rule, not the guideline.
</p>
<p>You <strong>SHOULD read the CURRENT <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a></strong>, <em>prior</em> to submitting
code to the contest.</p>

Uploading a tarball not formed by <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> puts you at a very big risk of
violating <a href="rules.html#rule17">Rule 17</a>, especially as <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> does a
great number of things that are required, and it also runs many checks, and if
any of those checks fail, you are at a very great risk of having your submission
rejected for violating <a href="rules.html#rule17">Rule 17</a>.

<p class="leftbar">
<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: the tools that require other tools, <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> and

While the contest is <strong><a href="../faq.html#open">open</a></strong>, you may modify your
previously uploaded submission by rebuilding your submission with the
<code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool and then re-uploading it to <strong>the same slot number</strong> on the
<a href="https://submit.ioccc.org">submit server</a>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
<strong>HINT:</strong> so that you do not have to repeatedly answer all the
questions, the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool has the options <code>-a answers</code>, <code>-A answers</code>
and <code>-i answers</code>, where <code>-a</code> will write to an answers file (if it does not
already exist), <code>-A</code> <strong>WILL OVERWRITE THE FILE</strong> and <code>-i</code> will read the answers from
the file. If you use <code>-A</code>, <strong>BE SURE</strong> you don’t overwrite another file by accident!
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Be aware that even with the <code>-i answers</code> you will still be required to confirm
most if not all <code>y/n</code> questions - you just don’t have to input the name of the
submission, the abstract, the author details etc. If you really wish to
circumvent this you can use the <code>-Y</code> option but we do not recommend this because
if your update breaks a rule or there is some problem, you might not see it.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
To help with not having to repeatedly enter a UUID, whether for the same
submission or multiple submissions, you can use the <code>-u uuidfile</code> or <code>-U UUID</code>
option. See the
FAQ on “<a href="../faq.html#uuid">how to avoid re-entering your UUID</a>”
for more details. Note that the <code>-i answers</code> option cannot be used with the UUID
options as the answers file includes the UUID.

<p class="leftbar">
The overall size limit (see <a href="rules.html#rule2a">Rule 2a</a>) on <code>prog.c</code> has been
<strong>increased from 4096 to 4993</strong> bytes.
The <a href="rules.html#rule2a">Rule 2a</a> size was changed from
<strong>4096</strong> to <strong>4993</strong> to keep the “2b to 2a” size ratio to a
value similar to the <a href="../faq.html#size_rule2001-2012">2001-2012</a> and
<a href="../faq.html#size_rule2013-2020">2013-2020</a> IOCCC eras.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
The <a href="rules.html#rule2b">Rule 2b</a> size has <strong>increased from 2053 to 2503</strong>
bytes.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Your submission must satisfy <strong>BOTH</strong> the maximum size
<a href="rules.html#rule2a">Rule 2a</a> <strong>AND</strong> the IOCCC size <a href="rules.html#rule2b">Rule 2b</a>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
To check your code against <a href="rules.html#rule2">Rule 2</a>, use the <code>iocccentry(1)</code> tool.
For example:
</p>
<pre><code>    iocccsize prog.c</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
The IOCCC size tool algorithm can be summarized as follows:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The size tool counts most C reserved words (keyword, secondary, and selected
preprocessor keywords) as 1. The size tool counts all other bytes as 1
excluding ASCII whitespace, and excluding any ‘<code>;</code>’, ‘<code>{</code>’ or ‘<code>}</code>’ followed by
ASCII whitespace, and excluding any ‘<code>;</code>’, ‘<code>{</code>’ or ‘<code>}</code>’ byte immediately
before the end of file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ASCII whitespace includes ASCII tab, ASCII space, ASCII newline,
ASCII formfeed, and ASCII carriage return.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
When ‘<code>;</code>’, ‘<code>{</code>’ or ‘<code>}</code>’ are within a C string, they may still not be
counted by the IOCCC size tool. This is a <strong>feature</strong>, not a bug!
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
In cases where the above summary and the algorithm implemented by
the IOCCC size tool <code>iocccsize(1)</code> conflict, the algorithm implemented
by the current version of <code>iocccsize(1)</code> is preferred by the <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
In other words, make sure <code>iocccsize</code> does not flag any issues with your
<code>prog.c</code>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
There are at least 2 other reasons for selecting 2503 as the 2nd limit besides
the fact that 2503 is a prime. These reasons may be searched for and discovered
if you are <a href="https://t5k.org/curios/page.php/2503.html">“Curios!” about 2503</a>.
:-) Moreover, 2053 was the number of the kernel disk pack of one of the judge’s
BESM-6, and 2503 is a decimal anagram of 2053.
</p>
<p>Take note that this secondary limit imposed by the IOCCC size tool
obviates some of the need to <code>#define</code> C reserved words in an effort
to get around the size limits of <a href="rules.html#rule2">Rule 2</a>.</p>

</div>
<p>You are <strong>encouraged</strong> to examine the <a href="../years.html">winners of previous contests</a>.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that <a href="rules.html">rules</a> change from year to year, so some <a href="../years.html">winning
entries</a> might not be valid submissions this year; what <em>was</em> unique
and novel one year <em>might be ‘old’ the next year</em>.</p>
<p>A submission is usually examined in a number of ways. We typically apply
a number of tests to a submission:</p>
<ul>
<li>look at the original source</li>
<li>C pre-process the source ignoring <code>#include</code> lines</li>
<li>C pre-process the source ignoring <code>#define</code> <em>and</em> <code>#include</code> lines</li>
<li>run it through a C beautifier</li>
<li>examine the algorithm</li>
<li>compile it (with flags to enable all warnings)</li>
<li>execute it</li>
</ul>
<p>You should consider how your submission looks in each of the above tests.
You should ask yourself if your submission remains obscure after it has been
‘<em>cleaned up</em>’ by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.</p>
<p>Your submission need not pass all of the above tests. In certain
cases, a test is not important. Submissions that compete for the
‘<strong>strangest/most creative source layout</strong>’ need not do as well as
others in terms of their algorithm. On the other hand, given
two such submissions, we are more inclined to pick the submission that
does something interesting when it’s executed.</p>
<p>We try to avoid limiting creativity in our <a href="rules.html">rules</a>. As such, we
leave the contest open for creative rule interpretation. As in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_life">real
life</a> programming, interpreting a
requirements document or a customer request is important. For this reason, we
often award ‘<strong>Best abuse of the <a href="rules.html">rules</a></strong>’ or ‘<strong>Worst abuse of the
<a href="rules.html">rules</a></strong>’ or some variation to a submission that illustrates this
point in an ironic way.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
The IOCCC has a rich history of remarkable winning entries created by
authors who skillfully employed various techniques to develop their code.
While it is <strong>NOT</strong> required, you are allowed to use tools to develop
and test your submission. These tools may include, but are not limited
to code generators, code analysis tools, static code analysis tools,
runtime analysis tools, machine learning tools, natural language models,
code copilot tools, so-called AI services, large language models (LLMS), etc.
If you do make use of such tools or services, then we <strong>ENCOURAGE you to describe
how you used such tools</strong> in your <code>remarks.md</code> file.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
You may use git, or services such as <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a>
to develop and maintain your submission. However, we <strong>DISLIKE</strong>
submissions that <strong>require</strong> them in order to build/compile your submission.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Submissions will be judged in an environment that has no <strong>IDE</strong>.
Any submission that fails to compile/build because it requires
an <strong>IDE</strong> will be rejected.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
We will use the <code>make(1)</code> tool, your <code>Makefile</code>, and other tools found in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification">Single UNIX Specification</a>
environments and systems that conform to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification">Single UNIX
Specification</a>
in the building and compiling of your submission.
</p>
<p>We do realize that there are holes in the <a href="rules.html">rules</a>, and invite
submitters to attempt to exploit them. We may award ‘<strong>Worst abuse of the
<a href="rules.html">rules</a></strong>’ or ‘<strong>Best abuse of the <a href="rules.html">rules</a></strong>’ or some
variation and then plug the hole next year.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
When we do need to plug a hole in the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> or <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC
guidelines</a>, we will attempt to use a very small plug, if not
smaller. Or, maybe not. :-)
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
There may be fewer than 2^7+1 reasons why these <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC
guidelines</a> seem obfuscated.

<p class="leftbar">
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Be sure that <strong>your submission works</strong> as documented in your
<code>remarks.md</code> file. We sometimes make an effort to debug a submission
that has a slight problem, particularly in or near the final round.
On the other hand, we have seen some otherwise excellent submissions
fall down because they didn’t work as documented.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If you submission has bugs and/or mis-features, you are <strong>MUCH BETTER</strong> off
documenting such bugs and/or mis-features in your <code>remarks.md</code> file.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Consider an example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number">prime number</a>
printing program that claims that 16 is a prime number.
Noting such a bug in your <code>remarks.md</code> file could save your submission:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>this submission sometimes prints the 4th power of a prime by mistake</em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes a strange bug or (mis-)feature can even help the submission! Of course, a correctly
working submission might be better.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
We tend to look down on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number">prime
number</a> printer that claims that
16 is a prime number.
Clever people will note that 16 might be prime
under certain conditions. ;-) Wise people, when submitting something clever
will fully explain such cleverness in their submission’s <code>remarks.md</code> file.
</p>
<p>People who are considering to just use some complex mathematical
function or state machine to spell out something such as “<em>hello,
world!</em>” <strong>really really, <em>and we do mean REALLY</em>, do need to be more creative</strong>.</p>
<p>Ultra-obfuscated programs are, in some cases, easier to
deobfuscate than subtly-obfuscated programs. Consider using
misleading or subtle tricks layered on top of or under an
appropriate level of obfuscation. A clean looking program with
misleading comments and variable names might be a <strong>VERY GOOD START</strong>
to a great submission!</p>

<a href="rules.html#rule17">Rule 17</a> (the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> rule) states that
you <strong>REALLY SHOULD</strong> use the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool to package your submission tarball.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
See the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry repo</a>
for the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool and below for more details.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: make <strong>CERTAIN</strong> you have the most recent version of the
<code>mkiocccentry</code> toolkit! See the
FAQ on “<a href="../faq.html#obtaining_mkiocccentry">obtaining the mkiocccentry toolkit</a>”.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
<code>mkiocccentry</code> runs a number of checks, by the tool itself and by executing
other tools, <em>before</em> packaging your xz compressed tarball, including running
<code>chksubmit(1)</code> on the submission directory.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If <code>mkiocccentry</code> encounters an <strong>error</strong>, the program will exit and the xz
compressed tarball <strong>will not be formed</strong>. For instance, if
<a href="#chksubmit">chksubmit</a> fails to validate the submission directory, either because
of a validation error in the <code>.auth.json</code> or <code>.info.json</code>
<a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">JSON</a> files or because of
something else that <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> creates or does, it is an
<strong>error</strong> and <strong>possibly</strong> a bug that you should <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=bug&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug_report.yml&amp;title=%5BBug%5D+%3Ctitle%3E">report as a bug at the

page</a>.
<strong>PLEASE run the <code>bug_report.sh</code> script to help us out here!</strong> See the
FAQ on “<a href="../faq.html#mkiocccentry_bugs">reporting mkiocccentry bugs</a>”.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Once the tarball is packaged it will
run <code>txzchk(1)</code>, which will also run <code>fnamchk(1)</code>, as part of its algorithm.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
However, even if <code>mkiocccentry</code> or one of the tools it invokes reports an error,
it <strong>does not</strong> necessarily mean it is a bug in the code. It might be an issue with
your submission. Thus if you report an error as a bug it might not be something
that will be fixed as there might not be anything wrong with the tools.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
On the other hand, some conditions flagged by <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> are <strong>warnings</strong>
and it allows you to override these, if you wish. If you’re brave enough you can
use the <code>-W</code> option to ignore all warnings but this is a big risk; the <code>-y</code>
option will assume ‘<em>yes</em>’ to most questions but this is also a big risk. Using
<code>-Y</code> will say ‘<em>yes</em>’ to even more prompts. Needless to say, we do <strong>NOT</strong>
recommend these options.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
In many places it will prompt you to verify what you input, allowing you to
correct details as you go along. Be advised that there is a default answer and
if you press enter it will proceed with that default, so make sure you have
provided the correct answer.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If you wish to <strong>test</strong> that your submission passes the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tests
without having to type in in answers each time, you can use the <code>-d</code> or <code>-s seed</code>
option to <code>mkiocccentry</code> for the tool to pseudo-randomly create answers for you.
For example:
</p>
<pre><code>    mkiocccentry -d workdir topdir</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: if you run an IOCCC related tool outside the repo directory
(specifying the absolute or relative path to the tool) and you have not
installed the tools (and we <strong>STRONGLY</strong> recommend you <strong>do</strong> install them),
then you will have to specify the options (such as paths) for the tools that are required like
<code>chksubmit(1)</code>, <code>txzchk(1)</code> and <code>fnamchk(1)</code>.

<h2 id="chkentry"><code>chkentry</code></h2>
<p class="leftbar">
<code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> will write two JSON files: <code>.auth.json</code> and
<code>.info.json</code>. These files contain information about the author(s) and about the
submission. After these files are formed, the <code>chkentry(1)</code> tool will be run on
the submission directory; this tool not only validates the two JSON files
(and runs specific checks on them after validating the JSON), but it also
verifies that what is in the manifest in <code>.info.json</code> matches the contents of
the directory, in addition to other checks. If <code>chkentry(1)</code> fails to validate
anything at all, your submission <strong>WILL BE</strong> rejected!
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: although <code>chkentry(1)</code> validates the files in the directory, it
only inspects the contents of the two JSON files; it performs other kinds of
checks on the other files, and those checks are run on the two JSON files as
well.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If you submit your own JSON files (other than <code>.auth.json</code> and
<code>.info.json</code>) then they do <strong>NOT</strong> have to be valid JSON.
However, if you do provide such invalid JSON files, <strong>PLEASE</strong>
document and explain this in your <code>remarks.md</code> file.

<p class="leftbar">
If <code>chkentry</code> does not pass and you used <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> it is <strong>very likely</strong> a

Assuming that <code>chkentry(1)</code> successfully validates your submission directory,
the tarball will be formed and then <code>txzchk(1)</code> will be executed on it. In this
case, there should be no problems, as <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> should <strong>NOT</strong> form a
tarball if there are any issues.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> is used and <code>chkentry(1)</code> fails to validate your submission

tools use a <em>clone</em></strong> of the <a href="https://github.com/xexyl/jparse">jparse repo</a> <strong>at
a <em>specific</em> release</strong>. Thus the <code>mkiocccentry</code> will at times be behind the
<a href="https://github.com/xexyl/jparse">jparse repo</a>!
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
You do <strong>NOT need to install</strong> <code>jparse</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/xexyl/jparse">jparse

static library from <code>mkiocccentry</code>’s <em>clone</em>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
The <code>mkiocccentry</code> toolkit <em>also</em> has a clone of <em>both</em> the <a href="https://github.com/lcn2/dbg">dbg
library</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/lcn2/dyn_array">dyn_array library</a>; the <a href="https://github.com/lcn2/dyn_array">dyn_array

installed separately, in order to use the tools in <code>mkiocccentry</code>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
In other words, <code>mkiocccentry</code> <strong>contains everything</strong> you need, and <em>even if you
do install</em> the libraries from their respective repos, it/they will <strong>not be
used</strong> when compiling the <code>mkiocccentry</code> tools. This is important to
make sure that you’re using the correct versions, which is also verified by

<p class="leftbar">
<code>txzchk(1)</code> performs a wide number of sanity checks on the xz compressed
tarball; if any issues are found (‘<code>feathers are stuck in the tarball</code>’ :-) )
<strong>AND if and <em>ONLY IF</em> you used <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code></strong>, then it is <strong>possibly</strong> a
bug in one of the tools and you might want to <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=bug&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug_report.yml&amp;title=%5BBug%5D+%3Ctitle%3E">report it as a bug at the

<strong>PLEASE run the <code>bug_report.sh</code> script to help us out here!</strong> You may do this
by running from the top level directory of the repo <code>make bug_report</code>. See the
FAQ on “<a href="../faq.html#mkiocccentry_bugs">reporting mkiocccentry bugs</a>”.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
As part of its algorithm, <code>txzchk(1)</code> will run <code>fnamchk(1)</code> on the
<em>tarball</em> to verify that the <em>filename</em> is valid. See the
FAQ on “<a href="../faq.html#fnamchk">fnamchk</a>”
and the <a href="#fnamchk">fnamchk section</a> below for more details on this tool.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
It is beyond the scope of this document to discuss the many tests that
<code>txzchk(1)</code> performs; if you wish to know, we refer you to the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/blob/master/txzchk.c">source
code</a> or the man
page. You might just find a fun option if you do either of these!
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Of course, as <code>txzchk</code> does not extract the tarball, it is possible that if you
manually package your submission tarball and/or find and exploit a missing
check, you could still be violating <a href="rules.html#rule17">Rule 17</a>.
</p>
<div id="extra-files">
<h2 id="including-optional-and-extra-files">Including optional and extra files</h2>
</div>
<p class="leftbar">
The maximum total number of files that may be submitted has changed to <strong>39</strong> files.
However, of those files, <strong>5</strong> are mandatory (<code>prog.c</code>, <code>Makefile</code>, <code>remarks.md</code> and
the two JSON files generated by <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code>, <code>.info.json</code> and
<code>.auth.json</code>).
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Additionally, three of the files, if included, <strong>MUST</strong> be
specific file(name)s <strong>AND</strong> in the top level directory, or they will be counted as
an extra file, not an optional file.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
In particular, any file that is not <code>prog.c</code>, <code>Makefile</code>, <code>remarks.md</code>,
<code>try.sh</code>, <code>prog.alt.c</code> or <code>try.alt.sh</code> will be counted as an extra file, and if
<code>try.sh</code>, <code>prog.alt.c</code> or <code>try.alt.sh</code> are not in the top level submission
directory they will also be counted as an extra file. The <code>.info.json</code> and
<code>.auth.json</code> files are not counted as extra files but are required.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
In other words, the actual amount of <strong>EXTRA</strong> files is <strong>31</strong>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If you use an optional filename for something other than their intended use
in order to get past the file limit, we will consider that an
abuse of rules. For more details on the optional files, see the
FAQ on the “<a href="../faq.html#try_script">try.sh script system</a>”
and the
FAQ on “<a href="../faq.html#alt_code">alt code</a>”.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If you <strong>REALLY MUST</strong> include more files than the limit allows, then you may do so by including as an extra
file, a tarball. This does <strong>NOT</strong> have to pass <code>txzchk(1)</code> tests; only the
submission tarball must pass the <code>txzchk(1)</code> tests.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If you <strong>DO</strong> include a tarball, and the build process or the program extracts
said tarball(s), the make <code>clobber</code> rule <strong>MUST</strong> remove the extracted files. Even so, if you
include a tarball to get past the limit on the number of files, you <strong>MUST</strong>
justify this in your <code>remarks.md</code> file.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
<strong>IMPORTANT REMINDER</strong>: make <strong>SURE</strong> your tarball does <strong>NOT</strong> reveal who you are!
The <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool creates a v7 format tarball to prevent this. You can
do the same like:
</p>
<pre><code>    tar --format=v7 -cJf foo.txz directory</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
See <a href="rules.html#rule17">Rule 17</a> and in particular the part about the <a href="../faq.html#max-files">maximum
number of files</a>. If you do not follow these points, you
are at a great risk of violating <a href="rules.html#rule17">Rule 17</a>!
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
<strong>NOTE</strong>: if you want to include a test-suite that requires a lot of files,
please suggest this in your <code>remarks.md</code> and if your submission wins it can
be done. In other words you should not use a tarball for a test-suite unless you
have a very good reason for this (and if you do, make <strong>SURE</strong> you specify why
in your <code>remarks.md</code> file).

As an important part of its algorithm, <a href="#txzchk">txzchk(1)</a> directly executes
<code>fnamchk(1)</code>. If the filename is invalid (or the filename does not match the

</p>
<p class="leftbar">
It is extremely unlikely that <code>fnamchk(1)</code> reporting an invalid filename is a
bug in <code>fnamchk(1)</code> and as such, ignoring such an issue risks violating <a href="rules.html#rule17">Rule
17</a> which is a big risk. Of course, using <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code>
would prevent this from happening as it would not create such a file anyway. If
<code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> was used it would rather suggest a bug in one of the tools and
you should <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=bug&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug_report.yml&amp;title=%5BBug%5D+%3Ctitle%3E">report it as a bug at the mkiocccentry issues

See the

</p>
<p class="leftbar">
As you can see, the use of <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> is <strong>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</strong>, and at
the risk of stating the obvious, you run <strong>A VERY BIG RISK</strong> of having
your submission rejected if you package your own tarball, and there are <strong>ANY
problems</strong>. For instance, if <code>chkentry(1)</code> found a problem in your <code>.info.json</code>
file, the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool would not package it. But if you were to package
it manually, you would be violating <a href="rules.html#rule17">Rule 17</a>. But even if
everything checks out OK you should <strong>NOT</strong> assume that everything <strong>IS</strong> OK.

Of course, it is also possible for <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code>, or one or more of the

It <strong>is OK</strong> if you need to require your submission to <strong>NOT be</strong> compiled

One reason that you might have to change the flags, is that the optimiser is

For compilers, such as <code>clang</code>, that have the <code>-Weverything</code> option,
while you may wish to try it, you should read our
FAQ on “<a href="../faq.html#weverything">clang -Weverything</a>”.
We do <strong>NOT</strong> recommend that you put
the use of <code>-Weverything</code> into your submission’s <code>Makefile</code> for the reasons
cited there. This goes even if your version does not trigger a warning as some
other version might!
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
On the other hand, if <code>${CC}</code> has “<code>clang</code>” in the name, the example <code>Makefile</code> will
automatically enable <code>-Weverything</code>, so you might have to use <code>-Wno-foo</code>
options anyway, as detailed below. See the
FAQ on “<a href="../faq.html#weverything">-Weverything</a>”
for more details.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If “<code>clang</code>” is NOT in <code>${CC}</code>, the <code>CWARN</code> variable will not be further
modified.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
There is no real penalty for compiler warnings. Sometimes
compiler warnings cannot be helped: especially in the case of
obfuscated C. :-) So if you cannot easily get rid of a compiler
warning, try not to fret too much.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
We <strong>LIKE</strong> code that has a minimum of warnings, especially under the
more strict <code>-Wall -Wextra -pedantic</code> mode:
</p>
<pre><code>    CWARN= -Wall -Wextra -pedantic</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
The two previous guidelines might be thought by some as being somewhat
contradictory. Isn’t life, and isn’t trying to satisfy “contradictory customer
requirements” all too often like that? :-) Try to minimize warnings if you
can.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If you manage to produce very few warnings, or perhaps no warnings at
all under the <code>-Wall -Wextra -pedantic</code> mode, then by all means brag about it in
your <code>remarks.md</code> file <strong>AND BE SURE TO TELL US</strong> the OS, OS version, compiler
and compiler version in which you observed this occurring (in case our OS and
compiler produces a different result: so your submission won’t be penalized for
not meeting your claims).
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
On the other hand, some warnings cannot be disabled and are enabled by compilers
without any warning option specified. These are sometimes inevitable in
obfuscated code and even in some non-obfuscated code, and you should not worry
about this, though it might be worth pointing out.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
For instance, some compilers like to warn about use of pointers as arrays, which seems to
be dubious, as it obviously can’t (always) be avoided, being a big part of C, so
you should not worry about this either; this is the warning
<code>-Wunsafe-buffer-usage</code> and the way to disable it is <code>-Wno-unsafe-buffer-usage</code>.
See also the
FAQ on “<a href="../faq.html#forced_warnings">forced warnings</a>”
and the
FAQ on “<a href="../faq.html#weverything">-Weverything</a>”.
</p>
<h2 id="disabling-warnings">Disabling warnings</h2>
<p class="leftbar">
If you do have to disable warnings due to <code>-Weverything</code> automatically being
included, you might wish to state this fact in your <code>remarks.md</code> file.
And even without <code>-Weverything</code> there can be warnings, as noted above.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If your submission issues lots of warnings but is otherwise
marvelously obfuscated in multiple levels, don’t worry about it. Nevertheless,
be sure that the warnings do not constitute a potential “<strong>show stopper</strong>”
compiler problem. Be sure that compilers such as both <code>gcc</code> and <code>clang</code> won’t
produce a compiler <strong>error</strong> and refuse to compile your code: unless for some
reason that is what you intend to happen in which case document that too in your
<code>remarks.md</code> file. :-)
</p>
<p>All other things being equal, a program that must turn off fewer
warnings will be considered better, for certain values of better.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
To turn off a compiler warning, in your submission’s <code>Makefile</code>,
try something such as:
</p>
<pre><code>    CSILENCE= -Wno-some-thing -Wno-another-thing</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
For instance:
</p>
<pre><code>    CSILENCE= -Wno-parentheses -Wno-binding-in-condition -Wno-misleading-indentation</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
If you do add “<code>-Wno-foo</code>” to your Makefile, consider changing:
</p>
<pre><code>    CUNKNOWN=</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
to:
</p>
<pre><code>    CUNKNOWN= -Wno-unknown-warning-option</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
Some compilers have reported this as an error, however, and if you have
such a compiler you might want to not add it, or at least note in your
<code>remarks.md</code> file, which OS, OS version, compiler and compiler version
that has such a problem.

<strong>NOTE</strong>: just because we offer a default way to use the <code>-D</code> option, we still

<div id="clobber">
<h2 id="the-clobber-rule">The clobber rule</h2>

<p class="leftbar">
When <code>make clobber</code> is invoked, we request that submissions be restored
to their original submission state. For example, any temporary files
(<strong>including</strong> the compiled program(s)) created during the build process, or
during execution should be removed by the <code>clobber</code> rule. In other words, the
only things that should be in the directory after running <code>make clobber</code> is what
is in your submission tarball itself.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
While people are free to manage their submission under <code>git(1)</code> or even use a
GitHub repo, dot-files and dot-directories such as <code>.git</code> are not allowed in a
submission.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
The <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool will ignore dot-files and dot-directories (such as
<code>.vimrc</code>, <code>.bashrc</code>, <code>.git</code> and <code>.github</code>) and not put them in the submission’s
compressed tarball. So while you may use such files and
directories to help develop your submission, they won’t be included when you run
the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> tool.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Even if you did manage to get dot files or dot directories in the tarball
somehow, <code>txzchk(1)</code> will flag it as an error. When the judges run <code>txzchk(1)</code>
on the uploaded submission compressed tarball, if anything is wrong, for
instance if you “sneak in” any dot files or dot directories, the submission
<strong>WILL BE REJECTED</strong> for violating <a href="rules.html#rule17">Rule 17</a>!
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
You may use whatever tools you need to develop your submission, including the
use of <code>git(1)</code> or <code>gh(1)</code>, just be sure that your submission code and your
submission Makefile don’t depend on such tools.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Of course if you do use GitHub to work on your submission, you might want to
make the repo private so you don’t reveal who you are. :-)
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If this is not clear, please do <strong>NOT</strong> use these tools to help with the
<code>clobber</code> rule! For instance, do <strong>NOT</strong> use <code>git clean</code>! Not only does this
depend on the user having <code>git(1)</code> but it also does not account for the
submission tarballs. Even worse is when someone does have it in a <code>git(1)</code> repo
it will remove files that are not under <code>git(1)</code> control! Instead, see the
<code>clobber</code> rule in the example Makefile to see how to manage this.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
In other words, for <code>make clobber</code>, do something like:
</p>
<pre><code>    clobber:
            ${RM} -f foo bar baz</code></pre>
<p>and <strong>NOT</strong> something like this:</p>
<pre><code>    # do NOT do this!
    clobber:
            -git clean -f   # WRONG !!!</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
And do <strong>NOT</strong> use <code>git</code> for any other <code>Makefile</code> rule either.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
<strong>NOTE</strong>: <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> will directly run <code>make clobber</code> in the submission
directory. And although it is not an error if this fails, if it fails because the
Makefile does not have a clobber rule, it will be flagged by <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code>
(you may ignore this but it does put you at a risk of violating the rules).

Of course, it is quite possible that only one invocation is

<p>Doing masses of <code>#define</code>s to obscure the source has become ‘old’. We
tend to ‘see thru’ masses of <code>#define</code>s due to our pre-processor tests
that we apply. Simply abusing <code>#define</code>s or <code>-Dfoo=bar</code> won’t go as far
as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.</p>
<p><strong>Many</strong> C compilers <strong>DISLIKE</strong> the following code, and so do we:</p>
<pre><code>    #define d define
    #d foo             /* &lt;-- don&#39;t expect this to turn into #define foo */</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
In other words, it is a compilation error, and in order to get older

<p>When declaring local or global variables, you should declare the type:</p>

We tend to <strong>like <em>less</em></strong> a submission that requires either

</p>

<p class="leftbar">
We <strong>DISLIKE</strong> the use of obscure compiler flags, especially
if <code>gcc</code> and/or <code>clang</code> do not support it. We <strong>suggest</strong>
that you not use any really obscure compiler flags if you can help it.

<p>One side effect of the above is that you cannot assume the use
of nested functions such as:</p>
<pre><code>     int main() {

     }</code></pre>
<p>On 2012 July 20, the <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> rescinded the encouragement of
nested functions. Such constructions, while interesting and sometimes
amusing, will have to wait until they are required by a C standard that are

<p class="leftbar">
We <strong>DISLIKE</strong> submissions that require the use of <code>-fnested-functions</code>.

<p>We prefer programs that do not require a fish license: crayons and

<p>If your submission uses functions that have a variable number of
arguments, <strong>be careful</strong>. Systems implement <code>va_list</code> in a wide variety
of ways. Because of this, a number of operations using <code>va_list</code> <strong>are
not portable and <em>must not</em> be used</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>assigning a non-<code>va_list</code> variable to/from a <code>va_list</code> variable</li>
<li>casting a non-<code>va_list</code> variable into/from a <code>va_list</code> variable</li>
<li>passing a <code>va_list</code> variable to a function expecting a non-<code>va_list</code> arg</li>
<li>passing a non-<code>va_list</code> variable to a function expecting a <code>va_list</code> arg</li>
<li>performing arithmetic on <code>va_list</code> variables</li>

We <strong>DISLIKE</strong> the use of <code>varargs.h</code>. Use <code>stdarg.h</code> instead.

We tend to <strong>DISLIKE</strong> the blatant use of tarballs in an attempt to simply get
around the extra file number limit. We realize there may be cases where a

<p>On 28 January 2007, the Judges rescinded the requirement that the
<code>#</code> in a C preprocessor directive must be the 1st non-whitespace byte.</p>
<p>The <code>exit(3)</code> function returns <code>void</code>. Some broken systems have <code>exit(3)</code>

<p>Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.
While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do

One line programs should be short one line programs: say around <strong>80</strong> to <strong>132</strong>

The program must compile and link cleanly in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification">Single UNIX

<p>At least one judge prefers to maintain the use of the

time of day during a leap-second where the value in seconds
after the minute mark is <strong>60</strong>.</p>
<p>The <code>Makefile</code> should not be used to try and get around the size limit. It is
one thing to make use of a several <code>-D</code>s on the compile line to help out, but it
is quite another to use many bytes of <code>-D</code>s in order to try and squeeze the
source under the size limit.</p>
<p>Your source code, post-pre-processing, should not exceed the size of

The <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a>, as a group, have a history giving wide degree of latitude

You may compile and use your own programs. If you do, try to build and execute
from the current directory. This restriction is not a hard and
absolute one. The intent is to ensure that the building of your
program is reasonably portable.
</p>
<p>We prefer programs that are portable across a wide variety of UNIX-like
operating systems (e.g., Linux, GNU Hurd, BSD, UNIX, etc.).</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fideism">Fideism</a> has little
or nothing to do with the IOCCC judging process.</p>
<p>Don’t forget that the building of your program should be done
<strong>WITHOUT human intervention</strong>. So don’t do things such as:</p>
<pre><code>    prog: prog.c
        #echo this next line requires data from standard input
        cat &gt; prog.c
        ${CC} prog.c -o prog</code></pre>
<p>However, you can do something cute such as making your program
do something dumb (or cute) when it is built ‘automatically’, and
when it is run with a human involved, do something more clever.
For example, one could put in their <code>Makefile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    prog: prog.c
        ${CC} prog.c -DNON_HUMAN_COMPILE -o prog
        @echo &quot;See remarks section about alternate ways to compile&quot;</code></pre>

alternate / human intervention based building.</p>
<p>We want to get away from source that is simply a compact blob of
bytes. <strong>REALLY TRY</strong> to be more creative than blob coding. <strong>HINT!</strong></p>
<p>Please do not use things like <code>gzip(1)</code> to get around the size limit.
Please try to be much more creative.</p>
<p>We really <strong>DISLIKE</strong> submissions that make blatant use of including
large data files to get around the source code size limit.</p>
<p>We do not recommend submitting <a href="https://systemd.io">systemd</a> source code to the IOCCC,
if nothing else because that code is likely to exceed <a href="rules.html#rule2">the source code
size limit</a>. This isn’t to say that another highly compact and obfuscated
replacement of <code>init</code> would not be an interesting submission.</p>
<p>Did we remember to indicate that programs that blatantly use
some complex state machine to do something simple, are boring?
We think we did. :-)</p>

Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob
of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C
program, we tend to favor the second version. Of course, a third
version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!
Remember, you can submit more than one submission. See the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC
rules</a> for details (in particular, <a href="rules.html#rule9">Rule 9</a>).
</p>
<p>We suggest that you avoid trying for the ‘<strong>smallest self-replicating</strong>’
source. The smallest, a <a href="../1994/smr/index.html">zero byte entry</a>, won in
<a href="../years.html#1994">1994</a>.</p>
<p>Programs that claim to be the smallest C source that does something, really
better be the smallest such program or they risk being rejected because
they do not work as documented.</p>
<p>Please note that the C source below, besides lacking in obfuscation,
is <strong>NOT</strong> the smallest C source file that when compiled and run, dumps core:</p>
<pre><code>    main;</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
Unless you specify <code>-fwritable-strings</code> (see <code>COTHER</code> in the example
Makefile, described in the <a href="#makefile">Makefile section</a>), do not assume this
sort of code will work:
</p>
<pre><code>    char *T = &quot;So many primes, so little time!&quot;;
    ...
    T[14] = &#39;;&#39;;    /* modifying a string requires: -fwritable-strings */</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
Even so, one should probably not assume that this is universally accepted.

Initialized char arrays are OK to write over. For instance, this is OK:
</p>
<pre><code>    char b[] = &quot;Is this OK&quot;;

<p>X client submissions should be as portable as possible. Submissions that

Don’t assume the use of a particular browser. Instead assume a
generic browser that forms to a widely used <a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/">W3C

Don’t assume a particular sound sub-system or video driver is installed
in the OS. Instead, make use of a well known and widely available open

<p>X client submissions should avoid using X related libraries and

<p>Anyone can format their code into a dense blob. A really clever
author will try format their submission using a “normal” formatting style
such that at first glance (if you squint and don’t look at the details)
the code might pass for non-obfuscated C. Deceptive comments,
and misleading formatting, in some cases, may be a plus. On the
other hand, a misleading code style requires more source bytes.</p>
<p>If you do elect to use misleading formatting and comments, we
suggest you remark on this point in your <code>remarks.md</code> where you talk

<p class="leftbar">
Even so, we do not recommend you try and submit a JSON parser due to
the fact it will likely exceed <a href="rules.html#rule2">the source code size limit</a>
and because you likely can’t beat <a href="https://github.com/westes/flex">flex</a> and
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/">bison</a> in obfuscation. This isn’t to
say that <a href="https://github.com/xexyl/jparse/blob/master/json_README.md#so-called-json-spec">the so-called JSON spec</a> is not
obfuscated, but unless you have some really clever way to compact and
obfuscate a JSON parser more than <a href="https://github.com/westes/flex">flex</a> and
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/">bison</a> you will likely not win, either
because of the <a href="rules.html#rule2">source code size limit</a> or because it is not
as obfuscated as the <a href="https://github.com/westes/flex">flex</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/">bison</a>

<p>While programs that only run in a specific word size are OK, if you have
to pick, choose a 64-bit word size.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If the <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> are feeling ornery we
might choose to compile your program for running on an Arduino or
a PDP-11. Heck, should we ever find an emulator of 60-bit CDC Cyber
CPU, we might just try your submission on that emulator as well :-)
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If your submission <strong>MUST</strong> run only on a 64-bit or 32-bit architecture,
then you <strong>MUST</strong> specify the <code>-arch</code> on your command line
(see <code>ARCH</code> in the example
Makefile, described in <a href="#makefile">Makefile section</a>). Do not assume a
processor word size without specifying <code>-arch</code>. For example:
</p>
<pre><code>    ARCH= -m64</code></pre>
<p class="leftbar">
Note, however, that some platforms will not necessarily support some
architectures. For instance, more recent versions of <code>macOS</code> do <strong>NOT</strong> support
32-bit!
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If there are limitations in your submission, you are highly encouraged
to note such limitations in your <code>remarks.md</code> file. For example if your
submission factors values up to a certain size, you might want to state:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This submission factors values up <code>2305567963945518424753102147331756070</code>.
Attempting to factor larger values will produce unpredictable results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> might try to factor the value -5, so you want to might state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This submission factors positive values up
<code>2305567963945518424753102147331756070</code>. Attempting to factor large values will
produce unpredictable results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However the <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> might try to also factor 0, so you want to might state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This submission factors values between 1 and
<code>2305567963945518424753102147331756070</code>. Attempting to factor values outside
that range will produce unpredictable results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="leftbar">
Moreover they might try to also factor 3.5 or 0x7, or Fred, so you want to might state:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This submission factors integers between 1 and
<code>2305567963945518424753102147331756070</code>. Attempting to factor anything else
will produce unpredictable results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You submission might be better off catching the attempt to factor bogus values
and doing something interesting. So you might want to code accordingly and state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This submission factors integers between 1 and <code>2305567963945518424753102147331756070</code>.
Attempting to factor anything else will cause the program to insult your pet fish Eric.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> might not have a pet fish named Eric, so you might want to state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This submission factors integers between 1 and
<code>2305567963945518424753102147331756070</code>. Attempting to factor anything else
will cause the program to insult your pet fish Eric, or in the case that you
lack such a pet, will insult the pet that you do not have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When all other things are equal, a submission with fewer limitations will be judged
better than a submission with lots of limitations. So you might want to code accordingly
and state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This submission attempts to a factor value of any size provided that the
program is given enough time and memory. If the value is not a proper integer,
the program might insult a fish named Eric.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="leftbar">
Do not fear if you’re not 100% sure of the significance of
<code>2305567963945518424753102147331756070</code> as it is not of prime importance: or is

</div>
</div>
<p>Legal abuse of the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> is somewhat encouraged. Legal rule abuse
may involve, but is not limited to, doing things that are technically allowed by
the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and yet do not fit the spirit of what we intended to be
submitted.</p>
<p>Legal rule abuse is encouraged to help promote creativity. Rule abuse
submissions, regardless of if they receive an award, result in changes to
the next year’s <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Legal abuse of the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> is <strong>NOT</strong> an invitation to violate the
<a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a>. A submission that violates the <a href="rules.html">rules</a> in the
opinion of the <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a>, <strong>WILL</strong> be
disqualified. <strong><em>RULE ABUSE CARRIES A CERTAIN LEVEL OF RISK!</em></strong> If you
have a submission that might otherwise be interesting, you might want to
submit two versions; one that does not abuse the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and one that
does.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If you intend to abuse the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a>,
indicate so in your <code>remarks.md</code> file. You <strong>MUST</strong> try to justify
why you consider your rule abuse to be allowed under the
<a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a>. That is, you must plead your case as to why
your submission is valid. Humor and/or creativity help plead a case.
As there is no guarantee that you will succeed, you might consider
submitting an alternate version that conforms to the
<a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
If you do bypass the <code>mkiocccentry(1)</code> warnings about <a href="rules.html#rule2a">Rule
2a</a> and/or about <a href="rules.html#rule2b">Rule 2b</a> or any other
rule and submit a submission anyway, you <strong>MUST</strong> try to justify why the IOCCC
<a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> should not reject your submission due to a rule
violation, and you would be wise to do this towards the top of your <code>remarks.md</code>
file.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Abusing the web submission procedure tends to annoy us more

We are often asked why the contest <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC
guidelines</a> seem strange or contain mistakes, flaws or
grammatical errors. One reason is that we sometimes make genuine mistakes. But
in many cases such problems, flaws or areas of confusion are deliberate.
Changes to <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> in
response to rule abuses, are done in a minimal fashion. Often we will
deliberately leave behind holes (or introduce new ones) so that future rule
abuse can continue. A clever author should be able to read them and “drive a
truck through the holes” in the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC
guidelines</a>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
At the risk of stating the obvious, this contest is a parody of the software
development process. The <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a>
are only part of the overall contest. Even so, one might think the
contest <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> process as a parody
of the sometimes tragic mismatch between what a customer (or marketing) wants
and what engineering delivers. Real programmers must face obfuscated and
sometimes conflicting specifications and requirements from marketing, sales,
product management and even from customers themselves on an all too regular basis.
This is one of the reasons why the <a href="rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and
<a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> are written in obfuscated form.

<div id="judging">
<h1 id="judging-process">JUDGING PROCESS:</h1>
</div>
<p>Submissions are judged by Leonid A. Broukhis and Landon Curt Noll.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Each submission submitted is given a random string and subdirectory. The
submission files including, but not limited to <code>prog.c</code>, <code>Makefile</code>,
<code>remarks.md</code>, <code>.info.json</code>, <code>.auth.json</code> as well as any data files that you
submit, are all placed under their own directory and stored and judged from this
directory.
</p>
<p>Any information about the authors is not read by the <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> until
the judging process is complete, and then only from entries that have
won an award. Because we do not read this information for entries that
do not win, we do not know who did not win.</p>
<p>The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular
individual. Therefore you <strong>MUST</strong> refrain from putting any information
that reveals your identity in your submission.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Now some people point out that coding and/or writing style might reveal the
information about the authors. However we consider this to be simply
circumstantial and outside the scope of the above paragraph.
</p>
<p>Some people, in the past, have attempted to obfuscate their identity by
including comments of famous Internet personalities such as <a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/honey">Peter
Honeyman</a>. The <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> are on to this trick
and therefore consider any obfuscated source or data file claiming to be from
Honeyman to not be from Honeyman. This of course creates an interesting paradox
known as the “<strong>obfuscated Peter Honeyman paradox</strong>”. Should Peter Honeyman
actually submit to the IOCCC, he alone is excluded from the above, as we
will likely believe it’s just another attempt at confusion. This <em>guideline</em> is
known as the “<strong>Peter Honeyman is exempt</strong>” <em>guideline</em>.</p>
<p><strong>BTW</strong>: None of the submissions claiming to be from Peter Honeyman have ever
won an award. So it is theoretically possible that Peter Honeyman
did submit to the IOCCC in the past. In the past, Peter had denied
submitting anything to the IOCCC. Perhaps those submissions were
submitted by one of his students?</p>
<p>Hopefully we are <strong>VERY CLEAR</strong> on this point! The rules now strongly state:
<strong>PLEASE <em>DO NOT</em> put a name of an author</strong>, in an obvious way, into your
source code, <code>remarks.md</code>, data files, etc., the above “<strong>Peter Honeyman is
exempt</strong>” notwithstanding.</p>
<p>We seemed to have digressed again … :-) Returning to the judging process:</p>
<p>We prefer to be kept in the dark as much as you are until the final
awards are given. We enjoy the surprise of finding out in the end,
who won and where they are from.</p>
<p>We attempt to keep all submissions anonymous, unless they win an award.
Because the main ‘prize’ of winning is being announced, we make all
attempts to send non-winners into oblivion. We remove all non-winning
files, and shred all related printouts. By tradition, we do not even
reveal the number of submissions that we receive.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
During the judging process, a process that spans multiple sessions over
a few weeks, we post general updates from our <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@ioccc">Mastodon

<div id="rounds">
<h2 id="judging-rounds">JUDGING ROUNDS:</h2>
</div>
<p>Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds. During a round,
the collection of submissions are divided into two roughly equal piles;
the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does
not. We also re-examine the submissions that were eliminated in the
previous round. Thus, a submission gets at least two readings and
often more than two.</p>
<p>Jump to: <a href="#">top</a></p>
<div id="readings">
<h2 id="judging-readings">JUDGING READINGS:</h2>
</div>
<p>A reading consists of a number of actions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="leftbar">
Reading <code>prog.c</code>, the C source and reviewing the <code>remarks.md</code> information
</p></li>
<li><p class="leftbar">
Briefly looking at any supplied data files
</p></li>
<li>Passing the source thru the C pre-processor skipping over any <code>#include</code>d files</li>
<li>Performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source</li>
<li>Passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor skipping over any <code>#include</code>d files</li>
<li>Compiling/building the source</li>
<li>Running the program</li>
<li>Doing other things that only <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> know about :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>In later rounds, other actions are performed including performing
miscellaneous tests on the source and binary.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
This is the very <strong>guideline</strong> that goes, <strong>BING!</strong>
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Okay, technically that was the <em>second</em> <strong>guideline</strong> that goes <strong>BING</strong>, and this
is the third. :-)
</p>
<p>Until we reduce the stack of submissions down to about 25 submissions,
submissions are judged on an individual basis. A submission is set aside because it
does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.
When the number of submissions thins to about 25 submissions, we begin to form
award categories. Submissions begin to compete with each other for awards.
A submission will often compete in several categories.</p>
<p>The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of submissions
we receive. A typical category list might be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>best small one line program</strong> (see above about one line programs)</li>
<li><strong>best small program</strong></li>
<li><strong>strangest/most creative source layout</strong></li>
<li><strong>most useful obfuscated program</strong></li>
<li><strong>best game that is obfuscated</strong></li>
<li><strong>most creatively obfuscated program</strong></li>
<li><strong>most deceptive C code</strong> (code with deceptive comments and source code)</li>
<li><p class="leftbar">
<strong>best X program</strong> (see <a href="#likes">OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES</a>
and the
FAQ on “<a href="../faq.html#Xorg_deprecated">Xorg being deprecated</a>”)
</p></li>
<li><strong>best abuse of ISO C or ANSI C standard</strong> (see above about compilers)</li>
<li><strong>best abuse of the C preprocessor</strong></li>
<li><strong>worst/best abuse of the rules</strong> (or some variation)</li>
<li>(anything else so strange that it deserves an award)</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not limit ourselves to this list. For example, a few submissions are so
good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.
We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.</p>
<p>In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of
reducing the remaining submissions (typically about 25) down to to about
half that number: declaring those remaining to be winners.</p>
<p>Often we are confident that the submissions that make it into
the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
make it. The selection of the winners out of the final round, is
less clear cut, however.</p>
<p>Sometimes a final round submission is good enough to win, but is beat out by a
similar, but slightly better submission. For this reason, it is sometimes
worthwhile to resubmit an improved version of a submission that failed to win in
a previous year, the next year. This assumes, of course, that the submission is
worth improving in the first place!</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Over the years, more than one <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judge</a>
has been known to <strong>bribe</strong> another <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judge</a> into voting for a
winning submissions by offering a bit of high quality chocolate, or
other fun item.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
One <strong>should NOT</strong> attempt to <strong>bribe</strong> an <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC
judge</a>, <strong>unless you are an <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judge</a></strong>,
because <strong>bribing</strong> an <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judge</a> by a non-judge
has been shown to <strong>NOT</strong> be effective when the <strong>person <em>attempting</em>
the <em>bribe</em> is made known</strong> to the <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a>
(i.e., they are not anonymous) AND/OR the <strong>bribe</strong> is otherwise
associated with a submission to the <a href="../index.html">IOCCC</a>.
</p>
<p class="leftbar">
With the previous guideline in mind: <strong>anonymous</strong> gifts
for the <a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> that are <strong>NOT ASSOCIATED
WITH</strong> a submission to the <a href="../index.html">IOCCC</a> may be sent to the
<a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> via the
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/3HSNTEL8RQ1M0?ref_=wl_share">IOCCC Amazon wishlist</a>.
It has been shown that receiving <strong>anonymous</strong> gifts provides the
<a href="../judges.html">IOCCC judges</a> with a nice
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine">dopamine</a> boost, and happy

<p class="leftbar">
See the
FAQ on “<a href="../faq.html#support">supporting the IOCCC</a>”.
</p>
<p>More often than not, we select a small submission (usually one line) and a
strange/creative layout submission. We sometimes also select a
submission that abuses the <a href="guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> in an interesting way,
or that stretches the contest <a href="rules.html">rules</a> that while legal, it
nevertheless goes against the <strong>intent</strong> of the <a href="rules.html">rules</a>.</p>
<p class="leftbar">
Nevertheless, see <a href="rules.html#rule12">Rule 12</a>.
</p>
<p>In the end, we traditionally pick one submission as ‘<strong>best</strong>’. Sometimes such
a submission simply far exceeds any of the other submissions. More often, the
‘<strong>best</strong>’ is picked because it does well in a number of categories.</p>
<p>In years past, we renamed the winning submission from <code>prog.c</code> to a
name related to the author(s)’ names. This is no longer done.
Winning source is called <code>prog.c</code>. A compiled binary is called <code>prog</code>.</p>
