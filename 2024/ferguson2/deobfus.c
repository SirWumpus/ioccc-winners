        * NULL. But something *extremely* nasty was done before we called this
        * function. I will explain it (or rather try to) in main() but it looks
        * like this:

        *   F((c=((~~!!~!9u|2**"9"-15u/ *"0"-2u)<<~~!~!~9u),c&=9u,&(struct a){ .l=1, .s=a[c],.v= { &w, &w } } ));
        *
        * Remember that c in main() (or our a->l) is argc. So this horrible call
        * resets c to some value, in particular 1 though that line does a lot
        * more.
        *
        * So what this part does is, again, set OUR v[0] to I() which we are now
        * calling, remember, and set OUR s (a char *) that is a->s to beyond
        * (argv[argc])+1 (starting out with argc == 1). This also sets .j to
        * a->k which is actually - what? This is sneaky. In main() when calling
        * Z() a->j is set to f (the linked list) but here we're setting a->j (in
        * the function call) to a->k. But in main() in calling Z() a->k is set
        * to NULL! Further down though we will do .z=a->j so this might (or
        * might not) be called a red herring.
        *
        * But of course we're not done!
