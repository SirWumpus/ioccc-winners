/*
 * Here I will guide all you sinning Oregon Trailblazers, at least a little bit.
 * Very little as the case seems to be given how much the code changed since I
 * did this one. Can YOU blame me for not trying to keep this updated? If you
 * can try looking at prog.c again.
 *
 * Please note that the order of events (the q = x(0,23)) might be in a
 * different order than the prog.c as some were added quite late and I just
 * pushed them in in prog.c without much thinking (which actually caused some
 * problems that had to be fixed). In prog.c the event numbers are 0,22 (a bug
 * in the submitted code was fixed - the switch was x(0,23) but there is no case
 * 23 there) but here you see it's 0,23 and the order is different. The son
 * mocking you if you eat his frozen body is not tied to an event in prog.c but
 * it is here.
 *
 * Actually this is closer to prog.alt.c in the sense that event 23 there also
 * has the son ghost mocking the PC. The difference is prog.alt.c has an event
 * 24 and that is not here. This almost certainly has fewer gotos in code (if we
 * count the comments probably not).
 *
 * Finally this code is from an earlier version so some of it might be missing,
 * not just the events, and not just the gotos, but potentially other things
 * too, possibly bugs that were fixed in prog.c but are not here (and no more
 * bugs remain in prog.c). But I believe this is more than enough to give you an
 * idea though if that is the case. If that's not clear...
 *
 * WARNING: this code and its comments are not up to date. I wrote 116 before
 * filtered through the cpp and 134 after the cpp and I didn't wish to
 * repeatedly revisit this file trying to explain everything. As it is I barely
 * finished this in time.
